    <h3>  How did the plastic problem happen? </h3>
         
    <ul> <li> Production and development of thousands of new plastic products accelerated after World War II, so transforming the modern age that life without plastics would be unimaginable. </li> </ul>
    <ul><li>Plastic is convenient and easy to get, this, in turn, led to a throw-away culture that reveals the material’s dark side: today, single-use plastics account for 40% of the plastic produced every year.  </li></ul>
    <ul><li>  Many of these products, such as plastic bags and food wrappers, have a lifespan of minutes to hours, yet they may persist in the environment for hundreds of years. </li></ul>
   
    <br>
    <h3> How is plastic manufactured? </h3>
    <p> Plastics are derived from organic materials such as crude oil, natural gas, salt, coal and, in more recent years, from bio-matter. Many thousands of different polymers are created by combining different organic chemicals in several ways.</p>     <img class="img_wrap" src="images/close_up.png" alt="Microplastic Close Up" title="Microplastic Found In Grass" width="250" style="float:right; "/>
    

    <h3> What makes plastic not able to break down (biodegradable)? </h3>
    <p> Plastics in use today are made of polyethylene terephthalate, or PET for short, and are nearly indestructible. It is nearly impossible to decompose PET plastics because most bacteria cannot break them down</p>
         
    <h3> Why is plastic having such a negative impact on the environment?</h3>
         
    <ul> <li> Plastic takes many years to decompose in the environment and when it does break down into smaller micro bits of plastic, toxic substances are released into the soil. </li> </ul>
    <ul><li> When plastic perish in sunlight and if burned, they release a toxic substance into the air causing air pollution.</li></ul>
    <ul><li> Researchers in Germany are warning that the impact of microplastics in soils, sediments and freshwater could have a long-term negative effect on such ecosystems. They say terrestrial microplastic pollution is much higher than marine microplastic pollution – estimated at four to 23 times higher, depending on the environment. </li></ul>
         
    <ul><li> Most of this plastic disintegrates into particles smaller than five millimetres (microplastics) and these break down further into nanoparticles (less than 0.1 micrometres) these particles enter the food chain through wildlife which has toxic effects. </li></ul>
